# Cloud Computing using AWS

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing began all the way back in the 1960s where multiple users would simultaneously access a mainframe computer. This idea quickly gained traction and developments were made such as grid computing, utility computing and virtualisation; however, the main idealogy stayed the same.

Nowadays, the term 'cloud computing' refers to on-demand delivery of computing services including computing power, storage and applications over the internet. Rather than storing data and running applications on a local server, which requires maintenance and large upfront costs, users of the cloud can access resources remotely through the internet by renting the infrastructure and platforms from a third-party cloud provider such as AWS.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **Scalability** - The cloud offers the ability to scale resources up or down rapidly allowing businesses to be flexible with demands without heavy investment.

- **Cost** - Cloud computing eliminates upfront investments (CapEx) and maintenance costs due to lack of physical infrastructure to manage. Cloud providers also offer pay-as-you-go to help businesses only pay for what they use (OpEx).

- **Flexibility** - Using the cloud provides users access to software applications and data anywhere in the world, further improving collaboration within remote teams.

- **High availability** - Cloud providers usually have fault-tolerant systems with redundancy options meaning data and applications can be backed up, even if one geographical area was to go down, it can be saved by having the data stored in another area. This helps to keep businesses running and minimise downtime.

- **Security** - Cloud providers employ security measures, update security regularly and offer access and identity controls to protect the infrastructure, data and applications of the businesses that use them.

- **Faster time-to-market** - Using the cloud enables businesses to deploy new applications rapidly, since virtually any size or number of machines can be taken out easily, thus reducing the time-to-mark a new product.

## What is AWS?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) was launched by the parent company, Amazon, in 2006

AWS is now the largest cloud computing provider with over 200 services including computing power, storage, databases, networking, logging and monitoring, analytics, machine learning etc. AWS is known for its high availability and scalability through its global infrastructure of 99 availability zones spanning across 31 regions.

## Other Cloud Service Providers

Other large cloud providers include Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud and IBM Cloud.

There are other cloud providers that may be more suitable for small and medium-sized businesses such as DigitalOcean, OpenStack and IONOS.

## What is IaaS, PaaS and SaaS?

- **IaaS** - Infrastructure as a Service is 

- **PaaS** - Platform as a Service

- **SaaS** - Software as a Service

## What is the difference between public cloud, hybrid cloud and private cloud?

- **Public cloud** - Public computing where a cloud provider (e.g. AWS or Azure) shares resources to the public as a pay-as-you-go model, with ‘unlimited’ resources/scalability (OpEx). However, there is low visibility and control over workloads.

- **Hybrid cloud** - Combination of public and private cloud, private may be used to store important/ private data whereas public can be used for scalability/ availability if private cloud runs out of resources.

- **Private cloud** - Private computing operated and installed by an organisation with limited scale, may be on-premise or third party (CapEx). The organisation controls all resources and hardware and needs a team to maintain it.

    > **Note:** on-premise is a traditional data center requiring servers, storage and network equipment

## What types of industry/business use the different types of cloud? (e.g. who uses a private cloud?)

## OpEx vs CapEx

- **OpEx** - Operating expenditure

- **CapEx** - Capital expenditure

Which is preferable and how does the cloud allow businesses to transfer to spending more on the preferred one?
